                                <h1>D’pM ORIGINALS: The story of a mid-summer-night dream into reality!</h1>                        
                                <p>10th April, 2016! The day when D’pM ORIGINALS was born. A dream of a civil engineer, turned into reality.
                                Initially, D’pM Originals was started by Mr. Divyanshu Mishra. For 6 months, he worked alone on his photography start-up, which he wanted to take at a professional level. After 6 months of sleepless nights and sweat breaks, finally, his work caught the lime light, and slowly the baby D’pM started to grow, crawl and walk. Eventually, he got 3 more people to work with him and today, this initiative is indeed a famous ‘Brand-Name’.
                                Ranging from Professional photo shoots to wedding photography, from getting picture perfect frames to making your photo speak a thousand words for yourself, D’pM ORIGINALS is indeed a perfect choice for all the events you’re looking for.
                                Every sector has different demand for their ‘picture perfect’ moments. Youth want candid to speak for them, kids want something which will just make them smile and of course, the elder and wise sector of the society looks for a nostalgic classic portrait! Whatever your desire and imagination is, D’pM ORIGINALS knows the subtle art of printing your thoughts down onto the screen!
                                In the words of Mr. Divyanshu Mishra, founder and CEO of D’pM ORIGINALS, “I just wanted to do something different. I wanted to present an example that following passion can give fruitful results even when others discourage you. The journey was not easy, behind this name, there are several setbacks, but at the end of the day, hard work pays! Yes, this is just the beginning. And Miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep!”

                                          <p>&quot;Amazing North East wedding photographers! We had our pre-wedding photoshoot at Jesmond Dene and absolutely loved every single picture, and had so much fun too! Jane and Stan were so friendly from the moment we met them, they were so kind and professional on our Wedding day too! We really loved the style of their photography, they created timeless photos for our special wedding photo album. We love looking through our photos and reliving our wedding day. We highly recommend!&quot;</p>

                                      <p>&quot;Although photography was one of the most important things to us on our wedding day, picking a photographer in the north east was surprisingly one of the easiest decisions we had to make. Stan and Jane were the very first people we met at our first wedding fair, as it was such a big thing for us we did look around at other people&#39;s work before committing... but absolutely no one in the North East compared.</p>
                                      <p>&quot;They were both fantastic from start to finish. From our initial meeting right through to our big day when they worked seamlessly together to capture the most magical moments of our day. If we had to plan it all again they would be first on our list!</p>
                                      <p>&quot;We knew Stan and Jane&#39;s work was amazing, but we were still blown away by our pictures. They captured every moment perfectly, we genuinely couldn&#39;t have wished for more.&quot;</p>

                                        <p>Stan and Jane covered our wedding. They are a class act. Personable, fun, yet hugely professional and the photographic output is stunning. We couldn&#39;t recommend them more. If you use Stan Seaton Photography for your wedding, you&#39;ll be investing in an extensive journey of support, advice, guidance and extensive experience. They have captured every moment of our incredible (and rather long) wedding day, leaving us with a permanent record of wonderful memories. Great people, great product.</p>
